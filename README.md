# Four-Squares-and-War-and-Peace-Solver

This Prolog program has two components, the first being a four-squares solver, and the second being a war and peace solver. It uses a constraint solver in order to solve a problem in moments which would otherwise take days, weeks, or months to solve exhaustively.

# Four Squares Solver
The concept of this problem is as follows: given any positive integer n, there exists at least one combination of up to 4 square numbers whose sum is equal to n. This solver finds all such unique solutions to any given n, and does so quickly.

# War and Peace Solver
The concept of this problem is that there are two warring countries who have begun disarming themselves as part of a peace agreement. Each month one country disarms one of their military units, and the other one disarms two. Their military units are represented as lists of integers.
Each integer represents the relative strength of that unit. The problem then, is to find a pattern of disarmaments with which at the end of each month, both countries have the exact same total military strength, and eventually both are completely disarmed.
